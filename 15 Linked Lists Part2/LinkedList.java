üß† REVISION NOTES:

üìå What is a Cycle in Linked List?
- A cycle (or loop) occurs when a node‚Äôs 'next' points back to a previous node.
- Causes infinite traversal (never reaches null).

üìå Floyd‚Äôs Cycle Detection (Tortoise & Hare)
1. Use two pointers:
   ‚Üí slow = moves 1 step
   ‚Üí fast = moves 2 steps
2. If slow == fast ‚Üí cycle exists.
3. If fast == null or fast.next == null ‚Üí no cycle.

üìå Cycle Removal Steps:
1. Detect cycle using Floyd‚Äôs Algorithm.
2. Reset 'slow' to 'head'.
3. Move both slow & fast by one step until they meet ‚Üí start of cycle.
4. Keep a 'prev' pointer to fast, then set prev.next = null ‚Üí removes cycle.

üìà Time Complexity: O(n)
üìâ Space Complexity: O(1)

‚úÖ Used in:
- Detecting and removing infinite loops in linked lists.
- Avoiding crashes or infinite execution due to circular references.
