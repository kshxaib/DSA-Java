Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique used for solving problems by trying out all 
possible solutions and discarding (backtracking) those which do not satisfy the problem constraints.

Itâ€™s basically a trial-and-error approach.
    - Similar to recursion, but with extra steps to undo choices when a path fails.
    - Used when the problem requires finding all possible solutions or an optimal solution 
      under given constraints.
