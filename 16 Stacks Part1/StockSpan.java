// Problem: Stock Span Problem
/*
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Given the daily prices of a stock, find the **span** of each dayâ€™s price.  
The span of a stock's price on a given day is the **number of consecutive days before it**
(including the current day) where the price of the stock was **less than or equal to** todayâ€™s price.

Example:
Input  â†’ [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 85, 100]
Output â†’ [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 7]

ðŸ‘‰ Concept:
- For each stock price, we need to check how many previous days had lower or equal prices.
- Instead of checking each day manually (which is O(nÂ²)),
  we use a **stack** to store indices of the previous **higher** stock prices.
- This way, we efficiently compute spans in **O(n)** time.

âœ… Key Idea:
Use a stack to maintain indices of previous higher stock prices.
Whenever the current price is higher, we pop smaller prices from the stack.

        spans[0] = 1;                          // Span of first element is always 1
        stack.push(0);                         // Push index 0

                spans[i] = i - prevHighIndex;
            }

            // ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Push current index into stack
            stack.push(i);

        // Calculate spans
        findStocksSpan(stocks, spans);

        // Print spans
        System.out.println("Stock Spans:");
        for (int span : spans) {

/*
ðŸ“Œ Dry Run:
Stocks: [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 85, 100]

Step 1: 100 â†’ No previous â†’ span = 1
Step 2: 80  < 100 â†’ span = 1
Step 3: 60  < 80  â†’ span = 1
Step 4: 70  > 60  â†’ pop(60) â†’ span = 2
Step 5: 60  < 70  â†’ span = 1
Step 6: 85  > 60,70,80 â†’ pop all â†’ span = 4
Step 7: 100 > all previous â†’ span = 7

âœ… Output â†’ [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 7]

ðŸ“Š Time Complexity:
O(n) â€” Each element is pushed and popped at most once.

ðŸ“Š Space Complexity:
O(n) â€” Stack stores indices.

âœ… Concept Used:
Stack + Previous Greater Element logic
