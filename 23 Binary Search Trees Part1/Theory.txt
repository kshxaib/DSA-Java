BINARY SEARCH TREES (BST)

1. Definition
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree in which each node follows a specific 
ordering property:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node’s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node’s key.
Both left and right subtrees must also be BSTs.

Eg:     8
       / \
      3   10
     / \    \
    1   6    14
       / \   /
      4   7 13


2. Complexity Summary
Operation	  Average Case	  Worst Case
Search	      O(log n)	      O(n)
Insertion	  O(log n)	      O(n)
Deletion	  O(log n)	      O(n)
Traversal	  O(n)	          O(n)


Key Points for Revision

BST property: Left < Root < Right
Inorder traversal → Sorted output
Insertion/Deletion depends on height (h)
Unbalanced BST → acts like a linked list
Balancing techniques (AVL/Red-Black) maintain O(log n) operations
